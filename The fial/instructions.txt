For the final exam you will be creating a script that fetches a random word and allows the user to guess either a letter in the word, or the entire word (thus ending the script), until a maximum number of guesses (5) is reached.


The random word will only be shown to the user as a number of underscores, e.g.:


_ _ _ _ _ _


As letters are correctly guessed, the "hidden" characters must be replaced with letters, e.g.:


p _ _ _ _ _


Until either the player runs out of tries, or is able to guess the word, e.g.:


p _ t h o n


The script must print a menu that allows the user to perform the following actions:
    - Viewing the current unsolved word
    - Viewing all previously guessed letters
    - Checking the number of remaining guesses
    - Guessing a letter
    - Guessing the entire word
